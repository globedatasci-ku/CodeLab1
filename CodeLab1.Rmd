# First, some words of encouragement

### "I can break code all day regardless of the data source." - Hannah Owens

### "Programming allows you to think about thinking, and while debugging you learn about learning." - Nicholas Negroponte

### "The most effective debugging tool is still careful thought, coupled with judiciously placed print statements." - Brian Kerninghan

# Some tips on troubleshooting

* What is the error?
  * Pay attention to line marks
  * Read error messages
    * When error message makes no sense, Google it!
* Ask for help
  * People you know
  * StackOverflow, GitHub, Reddit, Twitter, etc.
* Walk away (but come back)

# Some tips on troubleshooting: Print statements
* Where is the error?
* Why is there an error?

# Introduction to tutorial interface

# Introduction to tutorial interface
* You will get a link to an R tutorial.
* You will be split into breakout rooms.
* As a group, you will work to solve each problem.
* In between problems, we will regroup to discuss.

# Introduction to tutorial interface

.pull-left[
* A tutorial is a special kind of interactive R interface, powered by Shiny.
* Shiny is a framework for building web applications using R code.
* The app is published on the shiny.io server
  * You don't even need to have a functioning version of R set up on your machine!
